# Intro to Go
A few simple go programs used in introduction to go.

# Setting up an environment
Go: https://golang.org/doc/install

You can use Goland if you prefer. If you're looking for a free environment I'd recomend Visual Studio Code. It's fast, simple and has great Go support.

Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Install the go extension: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go

You might want to set `Format On Save Timeout` and `Code Actions On Save Timeout` if you're having problem with the tools. For example if the formatter doesn't run

That should be all you need to get going!
